### Getting Started


```
pip3 install rosbag-merge
```

 OR

```
python3 -m pip install .
```

This package currently uses icecream as the logger in order to better identify the locations of bugs. Eventually the logging will happen through print.



# Usage

Basic elements for usage are an in path and out path for data being processed and created, respectively.

```--outbag_name```
* Define an outbag name using the flag.

```--input_paths``` 
* Define global input paths for the data of interest. (csv or bags)

```--global_output_path```
* Define where to save newly created data (csv or bags)

```--topics```
* Topics which should be filtered. Use this to speed up all of the processing. To use all topics then simply omit the flag.

```--topic-file```
* Topics which should be filtered. Use this to speed up all of the processing. To use all topics then simply omit the flag. A file representing a list of topics. One topic per line.

```--write_bag```
* Including the flag tells ```rosbag-tools``` to write a new bag. Be sure to include an ```--outbag-name```.

```--write_csvs```
* Including the flag tells ```rosbag-tools``` to write a csv's with the topic data of interest.

```--merge_csvs```
* Takes the csvs in the input path and makes a single csv. The csv will fill topic data such that the new csv fills in data to share the same time and is easier to vizualize on plotjuggler or through matplotlib.

> NOTE : More arguments are available if you want to use specific CSV's or Bag files. Run `rosbag-merge -h` for more information.

### Some environment variables

```
export IN_PATH=/global/path/to/data
export OUT_PATH=/global/path/to/data
export OUTBAG_NAME=new-bag-name
export INPUT_TOPICS='/topic/namespace_1 /topic/namespace_2 /topic/namespace_3'
```

### Merge Bag Files

Make a merged bage with all topics.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_bag
```

To merge bag files with select topics, and make single topics csvs.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --topics $INPUT_TOPICS --write_bag 
```

To merge bag files with select topics, and make single topics csvs.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_bag --write_csvs 
```

Loop through the bag msgs and make single topics csvs.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_csvs 
```

Loop through the bag msgs and make single topics csvs.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH --outbag_name $OUTBAG_NAME --write_csvs 
```


### Merge CSVs

For now, merging csvs must be done **after** making the CSVs on a previous command.
```
rosbag-merge --input_paths $IN_PATH --global_output_path $OUT_PATH  --merge_csvs
```
